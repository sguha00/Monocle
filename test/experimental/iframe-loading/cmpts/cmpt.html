    <p>"Now it's our turn to show <i>you</i> some castles,
    Greta," said Anna, as she and her
    mother and Greta got in the car. Anna's
    mother had promised to take the girls on an
    all-day trip to northern Zealand. This part
    of Denmark is as full of castles as a plum-cake
    is full of plums.</p>

    <p>After driving about twenty-five miles
    along the shore, they came to Kronborg
    Castle, in the town of Elsinore.</p>

    <p>"This is the most famous castle in Denmark,"
    said Anna's mother.</p>

    <p>"Why?" asked Greta.</p>

    <span class="caption">KRONBORG CASTLE</span>
    </div>

    <p>"Haven't you ever read 'Hamlet,' Greta?"
    asked Anna in surprise. "Kronborg Castle
    is where Hamlet lived. Only Shakespeare
    called it Elsinore, which is the name of the
    town instead of the castle."</p>

    <p>As she walked across the old drawbridge
    and entered the outer yard of the castle,
    Greta thought that Kronborg was the loveliest
    castle she had ever seen. It was much
    larger and much more wonderful than Vosborg.
    When they came to the drawbridge
    across the second moat, Anna pointed out
    the high battlement where the ghost of the
    murdered king once walked.</p>

    <p>"Does he still walk there, Anna?" asked
    Greta.</p>

    <p>"Maybe he does, Greta. All we really
    know about him is what Shakespeare tells
    us in his play."</p>

    <p>When they crossed the last bridge and
    passed through the last gateway into the inner
    courtyard of Kronborg, Greta stopped
    in surprise. "Oh, Anna, it's so large and so
    beautiful." Then, just to show that she
    wasn't really afraid of climbing, she asked,
    "Tante Elsie, do you suppose we could climb
    to the top of one of the towers?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

    <p>From the little balcony on the tower they
    looked out over the ocean.</p>

    <p>"Is that an island across the water?"
    asked Greta.</p>

    <p>"Oh, no, Greta. That is Sweden, only
    three miles away. In the olden days, Kronborg
    was a fortress that guarded the entrance
    to the Baltic Sea. All the ships that
    came from the North Sea into the Kattegat
    and then into the Baltic had to pass this point
    of land, and every ship that went by here
    had to pay money to Denmark. Up here in
    this very tower there were guards who
    watched all the ships to see that every one
    stopped and paid for the privilege of going
    past this point. In those days, Kronborg
    was the most important castle in Denmark."</p>

    <span class="caption">THE MOAT AROUND KRONBORG</span>
    </div>

    <p>"Don't they have to pay this money now?"</p>

    <p>"No. About a hundred years ago Denmark
    stopped asking for this payment.
    Ships that are going to the Baltic Sea can
    now go through the Kiel Canal in Germany,
    instead of going all the way around Denmark,"
    explained Anna's mother.

    <p>As they walked down the narrow, winding
    stairs, Anna suddenly exclaimed, "Oh,
    Mother, we forgot to tell Greta why Kronborg
    is still an important castle."</p>

    <p>"Maybe she already knows."</p>

    <p>"No, I don't. Please tell me, Anna."</p>

    <p>"According to an old, old story, Holger the
    Dane sleeps in the dungeon that is deep below
    this tower. If Denmark is ever in trouble
    of any kind, he will awake and come to
    her rescue."</p>

    <p>"I've heard of Holger the Dane, of course,"
    said Greta, "but I thought he was just an imaginary
    person."</p>

    <p>"He's no more imaginary than a Nisse,"
    said Anna, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

    <p>Greta hated to leave Kronborg, but when
    Anna told her that they were going to see
    even finer castles than this one, she was willing
    to go. After driving about fifteen miles,
    they turned off the main road and drove
    down a long avenue of beech trees. At the
    end of this avenue there was a large white
    building, with a four-cornered tower rising
    from the center.</p>

    <p>"This is Fredensborg Palace, where the
    King and Queen live in the autumn," said
    Anna. "The King comes here for the hunting
    season."</p>

    <p>"Can we go inside this palace?" asked
    Greta. "I would love to see the Queen's own
    room."</p>

    <p>"Of course you would, little Margrete,"
    said Tante Elsie. "We will ask the guide to
    show us the Queen's apartments."</p>

    <p>It seemed to Greta that the guide took
    them through miles and miles of rooms.
    Even then, he showed them only a part of
    the two hundred and seventy rooms. The
    palace was much larger than it looked from
    the front, for it was very long.</p>

    <p>"Surely this isn't the <i>Queen's</i> room," said
    Greta, as she stood in the doorway of the
    large, sunny bedroom.</p>

    <p>"Why not, Greta?" asked Anna in surprise.</p>

    <p>"Why, I thought it would be a very grand
    room, with furniture of gold."</p>

    <p>Tante Elsie laughed. "Oh, Greta, you
    forget that the King and Queen of Denmark
    are people of simple tastes. This is a beautiful
    room, and it shows that the Queen likes
    lovely things. But it also shows that she
    does not spend money just to make a grand
    display."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps the young lady would like to see
    the ballroom," said the guide. "I think she
    will find that it is all that she imagined and
    really fit for a queen."</p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

    <span class="caption">FREDERIKSBORG CASTLE</span>
    </div>

    <p>He led them through several drawing-rooms
    and then into the ballroom. It was a
    large, square room, with windows clear up
    to the ceiling. The walls and ceiling were
    light blue, so that it seemed as if the room
    were open to the sky.</p>

    <p>"This is what I always thought a royal
    palace would be like," said Greta in deep contentment.</p>

    <p>"The ceiling of this room is eighty-one
    feet high," explained the guide. "It forms
    the tower in the middle of the palace."</p>

    <p>Greta didn't want to leave this lovely room.
    She was fascinated by the pictures painted
    on the walls, the gorgeous hangings at the
    windows, and the large groups of glass
    candlesticks that hung from the ceiling and
    sparkled like icicles as the sun shone on
    them.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to see the Queen's crown?"
    asked Anna, as they reluctantly left the
    beautiful ballroom.</p>

    <p>"The Queen's crown?" said Greta. "The
    Queen is in Copenhagen now; surely her
    crown wouldn't be here at Fredensborg."

    <p>"She has a crown here, too. It is really
    lovelier than the one she wears at court,"
    said Anna.</p>

    <p>When they came to the garden behind the
    palace, Greta saw what Anna meant. In the
    middle of the sloping green lawn there was
    a huge bed of pansies, arranged in the shape
    of a crown. In the lower part of the crown
    the pansies were all purple, and in the upper
    part they were all gold.</p>

    <p>"You are right, Anna. This is prettier
    than any crown of real gold."</p>

    <p>"Come, girls. We must be on our way
    now," said Anna's mother. "We have a long
    ride ahead of us."</p>

    <p>"Are we going to see <i>another</i> castle?"
    asked Greta.</p>

    <p>"Yes, the finest one of all."</p>

    <p>After a short drive through a large forest
    of beech trees, they came to Frederiksborg
    Castle. It was built on three small islands in
    the center of a lake. The castle itself was so
    large that it covered the islands completely
    and seemed to rise up out of the water itself.
    When King Frederick built the first castle
    here, nearly four hundred years ago, he purposely
    chose these islands in the center of a
    lake because they were the safest place for a
    castle. Enemies could not easily reach it
    here. When this old, old castle was destroyed
    by fire, a much finer one was built on
    the islands.</p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
      <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40647/40647-h/images/illus159.jpg"><img src="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40647/40647-h/images/th_illus159.jpg" alt="FREDENSBORG PALACE" title="FREDENSBORG PALACE"></a>
    <span class="caption">FREDENSBORG PALACE</span>
    </div>

    <p>As they crossed the bridge to the main
    part of the castle, Greta saw two women entering
    the main doorway.</p>

    <p>"Look, Anna," she said in great excitement.
    "Isn't that Princess Ingrid and Princess
    Louise going into the castle right this
    minute?"</p>

    <p>When Anna looked, the women had disappeared.
    Greta was now more eager than
    ever to visit the castle. Maybe she would
    see her beloved Princess Ingrid again.
    Would the Princess remember the little girl
    who had found her handkerchief on the stairs
    of the Marble Church? Greta wondered.
    She was anxious to go inside, but Anna
    stopped in the courtyard to listen to the
    chimes on the castle tower. Every hour of
    the day the ringing chimes played a different
    tune.</p>

    <p>"Let's see the Knights' Hall first," suggested
    Anna, when they went inside.</p>

    <p>Greta wanted to say, "Let's follow Princess
    Ingrid," but she didn't know which way
    the Princess had gone. So she followed
    Anna without a word. The Knights' Hall
    was the largest room Greta had ever seen.
    The walls were covered with hangings whose
    colored threads were woven in such a way as
    to show scenes from Danish history. Greta
    thought she would like to study history if
    she could learn it from pictures like these instead
    of from textbooks. While she was
    looking at one of the hangings in a far corner
    of the room, Anna grabbed her arm.</p>

    <p>"There they go, Greta. Don't you want to
    follow them?"</p>

    <p>Then Greta remembered that Princess
    Ingrid was here in the castle. How could she
    have forgotten? She and Anna and Tante
    Elsie left the Knights' Hall and entered the
    long series of drawing-rooms that filled one
    wing of Frederiksborg. Greta scarcely
    looked at the paintings that hung on every
    wall. She wanted to see a real live princess,
    not a painted lady in a golden frame. They
    walked slowly through room after room, but
    not a glimpse of the Princess did they get.

    <p>"I guess Princess Ingrid and her sister
    have left the castle," said Greta, in an unhappy
    tone. She was ready now to leave it
    herself, for it held no further interest for
    her.</p>

    <p>"Now for the most wonderful room of all,"
    said Anna, after they had gone through all
    the drawing-rooms. She almost had to drag
    Greta to the chapel, which formed an important
    part of the castle itself. When the
    royal family lived at Frederiksborg, services
    were held here every Sunday. This chapel
    was really as large as a church. As they
    came in, the organist was playing softly, and
    Greta sat down to listen to the music, while
    Anna and her mother went to look at the
    paintings which were on exhibition in the
    balcony of the chapel.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, Greta never remembered exactly
    how it happened. She must have closed
    her eyes for a minute in order to enjoy the
    music completely. The first thing she remembered
    was a soft voice saying, "Are you
    all alone here, my dear?"</p>

    <p>When Greta had opened her eyes and recognized
    the speaker she jumped to her feet.
    "Why, it's the little girl who found my handkerchief
    the other day. How very nice to see
    you again. When we saw you here asleep,
    we thought you had gotten lost in this great
    castle."</p>

    <p>Greta explained that her aunt and her
    cousin were up in the balcony. Then her eyes
    shone like stars and her heart almost skipped
    a beat as the lovely Princess Ingrid took a
    rosebud from the bouquet which she carried
    and held it out to Greta. "Perhaps you
    would like to wear this little flower," she said
    in her gentle way. Then, with another smile,
    she and the Princess Louise went out of the
    chapel.</p>

    <p>Greta stood like one in a dream. Now she
    knew how the knights of olden times felt
    when they had been honored by the King.
    She, little Margrete, had a flower from the
    hands of the Crown Princess of Denmark.
    All her life long she would remember this
    moment.</p>
